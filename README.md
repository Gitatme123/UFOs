# UFO Analysis
Analysis of UFO sightings displayed on webpage searchable by 5 characteristics: Date, Location City, Location State, Location Country, Shape, and duration!

## Purpose
####
The purpose of this assignment is to create a dynamic webpage using Javascript to insert it into html, and then displaying our data on the web. We have learned how to build a table that neatly displays the UFO data we are working with. Filters have also been added which allow users to refine their search based on their use case. The table is then visually displayed by the html on the webpage. We also use bootstap, html and css to format the page, and enable dynamic content, which allows users to enter in new filters to update their search. The end product is a visually appealing and interactive UFO sighting search!

## Analysis
#### When using the webpage to filter for data, we are given the following options:
1. Date
2. City
3. State
4. Country
5. Shape
#### Learning how to use this table filtering application is simple! When you type text into the white box, you can either press "Enter" on your keyboard, or click anywhere else on screen. This signals to the application that you are done entering in your filter criteria and the search can run. To add a 2nd filter, you can We have even removed the button to make it easier. To search for a specific thing, you'll need to type in into the 
> Since this is an Ice Cream and Surf Shop, the activities are commonly understood to be enjoyed in warmer temperatures. Therefore I am going to use warmer as an indicator of the significance of temperatures throughout the month.

> We also need to understand that W. Any did not give us any criteria for determining the significance of both June and December, and if we are comparing them against eachother or comparing them against the year on average. 

> Before we begin our analysis, we should gather the data and charts at our disposal. We have put together histograms and descriptive statistics for both June and December. We should use the charts to observe any obvious behaviors, and reference the descriptive stats to support/reject our hypothesis.

#### 5 takeaways from analyzing the resources created from the data
1. The number of temperatures recorded is relatively equal for both months with December having 12 % less recordings to analyze than June. I would be concerned if it were greater than 20% difference because that would mean an unequal distribution of data between the months.
2. The mean for June is 75 degrees and the mean for December is 71. Those are a little more than 5% of eachother and without feeling what those temperatures there actually feel like, I cannot say that the difference is statistically significant, although 71 is getting pretty close to being "too cold", especially with any breeze present, to enjoy ice cream and surfing.
3. The top 75% of June is still more than 50% of December. I can see this by referencing the bottom quartile's numbers. June's bottom quartile is 73 degrees making the temperature at or greater than 73 degrees 75% of the time. The mean is 75 degrees.  December has a lower quartile of 69 degrees, and a mean of 71 degrees. June therefore has a hotter lower quartile than December, so 75% of the time June will be at or above 73 degrees, where as December will only be at or above 73 degrees maybe 30/40% of the month. This bodes well for June, but does not bode well for December.
4. The standard deviation supports our belief in June being the superior month. June has a lower standard deviation than December, meaning there is less likely to be a large variance in the temperature in June, where as its slightly more likely to have variance in December. 3.26 in June vs. 3.75 in December.
5. Therefore from the data, and from personal experience, we can conclude that June would have better weather more frequently than December would.

#### High Level Summary
* My conclusion is that June is the "superior" month during the year when compared to December. 
* The weather is warmer in June more frequently and more consitenly than it is in December as noted in the analysis points above. The frequency of temperature recordings is greatest around 75 degrees in June, and around 71 in December. We can also see from the descriptive stats that there is a greater chance of having a cold day in December, which would basically foreit all sales for that day. June does not have a good chance of that happening with the lowest low recorded as 64 with December's lowest low being 56.
* June is a good month to be open for Business, but December is risky.


#### 2 additional queries I would run to analyze more data for the analysis
    1. A query to analyze the precipitation data by date and by station.
    2. A query to analyze the distribution of the data by station, because location even on a small island could play a large role in this.

#### What would help complete this analysis?
* We need to know a little more about the data, when throughout the dat were these temperatures recorded? Is it the average of the whole day? Were there other factors that could have significantly contributed to the average that should be considered outliers? Current events like a hurricane?
* I would like to have criteria in analyzing, but because we have no context, we can only make an informed assumption at this point.
* I would want to see data for January and February to compare, if the reason for the analysis was "trying to compare the peak of summer to the pit of winter". Those to me would seem to be the 2 coldest months that I would want data on to determine if we could be open at all those 2 months. June is also not the hottest month in many places, with July or August taking that award.
* I would also want to see the precipitation data for the dates and also the time of day. We know that temperature follows the basic patter of peaking in the afternoon and bottoming out after midnight in most places around the world. Precipitation in my environment is seemingly random, but I do know that in certain climates around the world it also extremely consistent. Regardless of its assumed distribution, it could be a very helpful addition to this analysis.
